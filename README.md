# Learning Tracker

Welcome! This repository is where I track key learnings, mini projects, and resources that are helping me develop my skills.

### Overview
I’m continuously working on mastering problem-solving skills. However, I also explore various other topics, such as **React**, **Java**, and other frameworks and tools, making this a comprehensive log of my learning across different areas of software engineering.

### Why a Learning Tracker?
Organizing my knowledge in one place helps me:
- Reflect on progress and revisit core concepts when needed.
- Structure my learning across multiple domains.
- Track my journey to becoming a well-rounded software engineer.

### Contents

- **React:** 
  - Exploration of React fundamentals, component building, and state management.
  - Hands-on **small** projects to reinforce React concepts.
  - Insights into component structure, data flow, and optimization.

- **Java:** 
  - Java streams
  - Practice exercises to reinforce understanding on streams.


### How to Use This Repository

Each directory corresponds to a specific area of learning, with code samples. Feel free to explore topics that interest you! The repo is organized to be a practical reference for myself.

### Future Plans
As I continue learning, I’ll be adding:
- **System design concepts** and case studies.

### Contributing
This is a personal learning project, but I’m open to discussions! If you have suggestions for resources, problem-solving techniques, or frameworks, feel free to reach out.
